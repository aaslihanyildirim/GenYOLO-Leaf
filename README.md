## üåøGenYOLO-LEAF: A Data-Centric and Open Source Framework for Generalizable Leaf Instance Segmentation Across Diverse Datasets  



## üñã Abstract

Maintaining plant health is a fundamental concern in many fields, particularly for applications such as disease diagnosis, growth monitoring, and phenotype analysis.  
Despite its importance, existing instance segmentation datasets often suffer from limited diversity in plant species and labeling, resulting in models with restricted generalization ability.  

To address these challenges, this study presents **GenYOLO-Leaf** ‚Äî a **data-centric**, **open-source** framework developed for instance-level leaf segmentation with enhanced generalizability.  
Leveraging diverse datasets enriched with detailed annotations, GenYOLO-Leaf supports transfer learning and robust segmentation across tasks.  

### üîë Key Features

- **üéØ Data-Centric and Generalizable**  
  Built upon the GenYOLO-Leaf framework, this project adopts a data-centric paradigm to address a wide range of applications, including plant phenotyping, disease detection, growth monitoring, leaf counting, leaf grafting, and background removal. The framework emphasizes generalization across diverse domains.

- **‚ö° Efficient Transfer Learning Resource**  
  Pre-trained models and weights are openly provided, enabling efficient adaptation to new tasks with significantly reduced training and inference costs.

- **üõ† Zero-Shot Benchmarking Across Datasets**  
  The framework has been rigorously evaluated through zero-shot benchmarking across eight widely used public datasets, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to various segmentation scenarios.

- **ü§ù Community-Supported and Hardware-Compatible**  
  Designed for compatibility with a variety of hardware configurations, the framework is supported by an active open-source community, facilitating scalability, extensibility, and collaborative development.

- **üåê Open Access and Extensibility**  
  The full framework, including source code and pre-trained weights, is publicly available to encourage reproducibility, transparency, and continued innovation within the research community.
